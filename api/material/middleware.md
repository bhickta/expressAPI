In Express, middleware functions can be added to two different stacks: the global middleware stack and the route middleware stack.

Global Middleware Stack
The global middleware stack contains middleware functions that are applied to all incoming HTTP requests to the application. These middleware functions are added to the stack using the app.use() method without any path specified, like so:

php
Copy code
app.use(middlewareFunction);
When an incoming HTTP request is received by the application, it passes through the global middleware stack in the order that the middleware functions were added. Each middleware function can modify the request and response objects or terminate the request-response cycle by sending a response or passing control to the next middleware function using the next() function.

Route Middleware Stack
The route middleware stack contains middleware functions that are specific to a particular route. These middleware functions are added to the stack using the router.use() method or the router.METHOD() methods, like so:

csharp
Copy code
router.use(middlewareFunction);
router.get('/example', middlewareFunction, routeHandler);
When an incoming HTTP request matches a particular route, the request passes through the middleware functions in the route middleware stack in the order that they were added. Each middleware function can modify the request and response objects or pass control to the next middleware function using the next() function. Once all the middleware functions have been executed, the final route handler function is called to send a response to the client.

Order of Execution
The order in which middleware functions are added to the stack determines the order in which they are executed. Middleware functions that are added to the stack earlier will be executed before those that are added later. This order of execution applies to both the global middleware stack and the route middleware stack.

It's important to note that the order in which middleware functions are executed can have a significant impact on the behavior of the application. For example, if a middleware function that checks if the user is authenticated is added after a route that requires authentication, the route will be executed before the authentication check is performed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the route.

In summary, middleware functions can be added to two different stacks in an Express application: the global middleware stack and the route middleware stack. The order in which middleware functions are added determines the order in which they are executed, and this can have a significant impact on the behavior of the application.
