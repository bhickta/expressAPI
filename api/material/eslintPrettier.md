To set up ESLint in an Express.js project, you can follow these steps:

Install ESLint as a development dependency in your project using npm or yarn:
css
Copy code
npm install eslint --save-dev
or

sql
Copy code
yarn add eslint --dev
Create an ESLint configuration file using the following command:
csharp
Copy code
npx eslint --init
This will launch a wizard that will guide you through setting up the configuration file. You can choose the options that best fit your project's needs.

Add the necessary plugins and configuration to your .eslintrc.js file. Here's an example configuration that uses the eslint-plugin-node plugin for Node.js specific rules:
javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
  env: {
    node: true,
  },
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:node/recommended',
  ],
  plugins: [
    'node',
  ],
  rules: {
    // Add your custom rules here
  },
};
Finally, you can configure ESLint to run automatically in your IDE or text editor. For example, if you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the ESLint extension and configure it to run on file save.
That's it! You now have ESLint set up in your Express.js project.

To set up Prettier in an Express.js project, you can follow these steps:

Install Prettier as a development dependency in your project using npm or yarn:
css
Copy code
npm install prettier --save-dev
or

sql
Copy code
yarn add prettier --dev
Create a Prettier configuration file by creating a .prettierrc file in your project's root directory. Here's an example configuration:
json
Copy code
{
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true
}
You can customize the configuration according to your preferences.

Add an npm script to format your code using Prettier. In your package.json file, add the following script:
swift
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.js\""
}
This script will format all JavaScript files in your project using Prettier.

Finally, you can configure your IDE or text editor to use Prettier to format your code automatically. For example, if you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the Prettier extension and configure it to format on file save.
That's it! You now have Prettier set up in your Express.js project. When you run the npm run format command, Prettier will format your code according to your configuration.
